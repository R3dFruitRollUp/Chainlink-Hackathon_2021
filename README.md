What we hoped to accomplish;
  Our hopes were to complete a randomly colorized SVG that was premade in order to mint a seies of Cow NFT's that utilizing the Chainlink VRF number.
  This number is then used to take the base number and convert it to the corresponding encoding of an HTML color code that is used as
  The color for the spots on the cow which consists of a quick loop to iterate over all of this.
  
  These MooMoo's are still in it's alpha phase of testing and requires a little further work to start hot swapping new SVG files in to recreate this process over
  with new images.
