# Chainlik-Hackathon
Code Repository for the chainlink hackathon

This readme file is a draft and should be edited to include details around what the project is our ethos and how we plan to execute on the project in high level detail. This requires we make some markdown edits, do some graphics in excel or word and put them into the markdown itself to help illustrate what we're doing.
